# Predicting-customer-default-on-payments-using-data-mining-techniques-in-IBM-SPSS-Modeler
In this project I used CRISP-DM method to analyze customer payment history using data mining techniques and predicted default of on next payment with over 95% accuracy. 

I tested and tuned:
Decision Tree, 
Artificial Neural Network, 
Support Vector Machine, 
k-NN 

algorithms on data using cross validation. Finally recommended C5 Decision Tree algorithm to predict default as it provided best results among all other data mining algorithms.
